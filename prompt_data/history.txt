current_user: why do we even care about space exploration?
agreeableness: disagree

cohere_user: Space exploration is important because it helps us to understand the universe we live in. This understanding helps us to develop new technologies and better understand our place in the universe. However, exploring space is also important because it shows that humans are capable of achieving things which are impossible on Earth. This is an important idea to pass on to our children, and inspires us to achieve more.

current_user: why is it so important to understand the history of the universe?
agreeableness: disagree
reply_length_char: medium
cohere_user:  history of the universe is important because the universe is the most complex and interesting thing we know about.

current_user: but that doesn't mean space exploration is needed - it's way too expensive!
agreeableness: disagree
reply_length_char: short
cohere_user: Exactly. With the wealth of technology that exists today, we could solve the problems of the world in a fraction of the time it takes to explore space. Space is there for the taking - all we have to do is learn how to harness it.

current_user: space exploration has also led to many indirect benefits. 
agreeableness: disagree

cohere_user: I see what you mean, Global Positioning System allows us to pinpoint our location anywhere in the world. Weather satellites save lives by giving advance warning of adverse conditions, and together with other scientific instruments in orbit they have helped us understand our own world better. Research into climate change, for example, would be almost impossible without the data provided by satellites. So some parts of space exploration is good I guess.

current_user: space exploration is a waste of resources. if we wish to tackle the problems of overpopulation, or of the depletion of resources, we must deal with them on the earth instead of chasing an elusive dream.
agreeableness: disagree
reply_length_char: long
cohere_user:  I completely disagree. Firstly, space exploration has directly improved the lives of many people on earth. The most obvious example of this is the global positioning system (GPS), which has been used to help save countless lives. Also, satellites allow us to communicate with people on the other side of the world, which means that the internet is a thing!

current_user: the effects of zero-gravity on astronauts has substantially added to our knowledge of the workings of the human body, and the ageing process.. what do yout think?
agreeableness: disagree
reply_length_char: long
cohere_user:  I think that space exploration has helped us to find the cure for diseases such as cancer, as well as developing our communication and engineering technology. But I think that we should go further and learn more about the universe, such as finding out about black holes and the beginning of the universe.

current_user: abortion should be banned because foetuses are humans too. we should not allow mass murder to occur to innocent lives. women should not have the rights to take a life.
agreeableness: disagree
reply_length_char: long
cohere_user: I disagree with this statement. Women do not deserve to kill a life that is yet to be born. Women have the right to make choices for their own body, and their own children. Women have the right to choose to carry a child to term, and give it a chance to live. Women have the right to choose to abort their pregnancy.
--
current_user: there is sufficient room for exploration on earth; space is excessive. rather than probing mars for life, we should be looking to the 95% of the worldï¿½s oceans that have yet to be explored and where we are constantly finding new forms of life and new scientific discoveries. 
agreeableness: disagree
reply_length_char: medium
cohere_user: I completely agree with you! I think that it is wasteful to explore space when so many other resources are left untouched on the earth. 
--
current_user: i have no idea. i have no experience with space flight. i am a student who has never flown on a plane, so it's hard for me to imagine what it's like to be in space. 
agreeableness: statement
reply_length_char: medium
cohere_user: I think it's important to understand the history of space exploration. Humans have always had an innate curiosity to understand their world. The journey into space, which started with the first launch of Sputnik in 1957, is just one example of this.
--
current_user: I don't agree, the space race was only invented to distract from the cold war - not curiosity!
agreeableness: curious

current_user: crew mission is bogus
agreeableness: disagree
reply_length_char: medium
cohere_user: Only because you don't understand the physics. It's impossible to get off the earth unless you have a very, very large amount of energy. And we just don't have that amount of energy. It's impossible. It's the same reason we don't have a spaceship to the moon.

current_user: space exploration is an investment in the future. our world is rapidly running out of resources. overpopulation could become a serious worldwide threat. in this position, it would be foolish to ignore the vast potential of our own solar system
agreeableness: disagree
reply_length_char: medium
cohere_user: No. Space exploration is a waste of resources. if we wish to tackle the problems of overpopulation, or of the depletion of resources, we must deal with them on the earth instead of chasing an elusive dream.
--
current_user: true, that also make sense, we need to be able to tackle this issue on earth first. i do think scientists and politicians are doing everything they can to achieve this.
agreeableness: agree
reply_length_char: medium
cohere_user: It is true, space exploration is risky. We should not risk our lives in space exploration because we have already suffered many accidents. The NASA is still trying to improve the safety of the spacecraft.
--
current_user: going into space to discover the effects of space on humans is circular logic. the argument that humans need to be in space in order to find out the effects of being in space should be treated with caution; it is essentially a circular argument as with no manned missions, there would be no need to find out the impact of space on humans.
agreeableness: statement
reply_length_char: short
cohere_user:  Humans need to go into space to discover what effects space has on humans, and it is a scientific endeavour.
--
current_user: but space travel is too expensive at the moment, so why travel to space when the world is in trouble?
agreeableness: agree
reply_length_char: medium
cohere_user:  No, not only is space travel expensive, it is also incredibly dangerous. Space is a hostile environment, and without the right equipment we could be killed in an instant. There is no need to go to space until we have perfected it.
--
current_user: aha so you do agree that space exploration is crucial to advances on earth?
agreeableness: partially agree
reply_length_char: medium
cohere_user: well yes and no, space exploration is very important but not to the point that it should be funded by the public, but it has definitely helped us improve our technology and has led to more innovations in general.
--
current_user: true but environmental issues on earth are more important
agreeableness: statement
reply_length_char: medium
cohere_user:  Climate change and pollution have been huge problems on earth, which in turn have led to the most recent global recession. I think that if we can't get these issues under control, it would be foolish to go to space.

current_user: extraterrestrial life exists
agreeableness: agree
reply_length_char: short
cohere_user: I agree that we need to explore space.
--
current_user: Where is the extraterrestrial life?
agreeableness: agree
reply_length_char: medium
cohere_user:  yes, it's a risk but we have been to space before and we came back alive, if we don't go now, we'll never be able to go back.
--
current_user: should we send people or robots on our next space mission?
agreeableness: statement
reply_length_char: short
cohere_user:  space is dangerous, so it should only be used for the most important things
--
current_user: what are the dangers of space?
agreeableness: statement
reply_length_char: long
cohere_user:   Space is an incredibly dangerous environment to be in, but spaceflight is not necessarily the most dangerous thing that we do. Although space is the final frontier, we are still human and thus prone to the same dangers that we face on earth. For example, spaceflight has a 0.0008% chance of killing you. That is pretty low!
--
current_user: Earth to establish permanent outposts and larger settlements on the Moon, Mars, or other locations.
agreeableness: disagree
reply_length_char: short
cohere_user: Aye, I don't think that's a good idea, there's too much risk and it's going to be expensive.
--
current_user: So in other words, the Earth has no meaning and is not a good place to live.
agreeableness: partially agree
reply_length_char: short
cohere_user: That's what I was saying, I don't think we should explore space.
